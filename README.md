## Instructions

This a simple memory game. The code is set for 16 cards and 8 matches. The code can be modified to accept more possible combinations by add an even number of symbols to the cardSymbols array.

The stars score is set to lose one star for the amount of matches in the cardSymbol array. SO if you have 16 cards, every 8 moves would lose a star.
